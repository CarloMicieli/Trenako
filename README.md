## Features

tbd

## Tech Stack

* ðŸ¦€ `Rust`
* `Cargo` and `cargo-make`
* `Docker` / `Docker compose`

## How to run

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/CarloMicieli/trenako
  cd trenako

  docker compose up
```

- The database admin webpage is available at http://localhost:9000/
- The open api documentation is available at http://localhost:9001/

### Local development

All the most important tasks are defined in the `Makefile.toml` for `cargo-make`.

In order to install `cargo-make` just run the following command:

```bash
  cargo install --force cargo-make
```

To run the `postgres` database as detached docker container:

```bash
  cargo make docker-postgres-run
```

to execute the database migrations:

```bash
  cargo make db-migrate
```

The sqlx `query!` macro is checking the query commands against a live database, to avoid to fail the build when a database is not available the offline mode is handled saving the query information into a json file. To update the file run the following command:

```bash
  cargo make db-update-offline
```

### Start the server

```bash
  cargo make run

#### Environment variables

| Variable            | Description              |
|---------------------|--------------------------|
| `SERVER_HOST`       | the server host name     |
| `SERVER_PORT`       | the server port number   |
| `SERVER_WORKERS`    | the number of workers    |
| `DATABASE_NAME`     | the database name        |
| `DATABASE_USERNAME` | the database username    |
| `DATABASE_PASSWORD` | the database password    |
| `DATABASE_HOST`     | the database hostname    |
| `DATABASE_PORT`     | the database port number |

### Checks

Run all tests with the following command:

```bash
  cargo make test
```

The rust code is following the rust formatting standard (via `rustfmt`), to check if the formatting is correct:

```bash
  cargo make format
```

To run the rust linter (`clippy`):

```bash
  cargo make clippy
```
