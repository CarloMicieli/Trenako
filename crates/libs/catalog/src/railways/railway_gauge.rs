    /// It was used by European colonial powers, such as the French, British and German Empires.
    /// In Europe, large metre-gauge networks remain in use in Switzerland, Spain and many European
    /// towns with urban trams, but most metre-gauge local railways in France, Germany and Belgium
    /// closed down in the mid-20th century, although many still remain. With the revival of urban
    /// rail transport, metre-gauge light metros were established in some cities, and in other cities,
